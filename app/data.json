        "summary": "I was originally born in Daytona Beach Florida, but I don’t remember much from my time there as my family moved away when I was still very young. This was the first in a long line of moves I would later go on to do, starting with Michigan, then Virginia, back to Florida, then Maryland, back to Virginia again, and then finally New York which is where I currently live. Most people think moving around that much is a bad thing, but I never viewed it this way. I looked at it as a way to see new places and meet all kinds of people and actually started looking forward to moving. I also look back at how moving so much grew some very useful skills of mine like flexibility and adaptability. Aside from having moved around, some hobbies I picked up along the way include a love for Soccer, Bouldering, computer building, cooking, sports in general, programming, Homelabbing, and gaming to name a few. It was these hobbies and interests that shaped my path forward and ultimately led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, as from an early age I’ve been fascinated with computers and how they work. My goal moving forward is to take the degree I’ve earned and use it to contribute to a software project in a meaningful way. I love problem solving and look forward to seeing how I can use the skills I’ve learned to solve complex problems.",
