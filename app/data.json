    {
        "summary": "From a young age, I’ve been driven by curiosity—taking apart phones, computers, and any electronics I could find to understand how they work. That passion led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I’ve channeled my inquisitive nature into mastering how computers work, exploring the best technologies for specific applications, and optimizing efficiency in software solutions. I've been fortunate to intern at some great companies while pursuing my degree in Computer Science. These companies really helped me to take the skills I learned in the classroom and apply them in a practical setting. I started off with mobile app development, crafting a modern app using Flutter and Firebase to meet client specs. At MKS, I worked as a .NET developer, enhancing DLL libraries for RF generators and streamlining processes with Jenkins and JavaScript automation scripts. Most recently, at Precision Optical Technologies, I tackled everything from embedded C development and Django-based data analytics to Electron cross-platform apps, React Android development, Docker containerization, and Python APIs for engineering workflows. I’m passionate about writing efficient, impactful code and thrive in dynamic, problem-solving environments. My goal? To join a forward-thinking team where I can contribute to innovative software solutions. When I’m not coding, I’m managing and improving my homelab with a goal of de-googling my life. Let’s connect to talk tech, opportunities, or the next big project!",
